                                The counterintuitive concepts of quantum mechanics have revolutionised our understanding of reality. Is Quantum Mechanics really a completely abstract concept or is does it arise from things we have known all along? <b>Abhisek Sahu </b>  attempts to find the relations between classical mechanics and Quantum mechanics
